literate-programming
====================

Creating a literate programming tool using itself. 

The first step is done. lp1.js is compiles lp1.md to make lp1.js. It will also be used to compile lp2.md.

To use, install node.js and use node lp1.js  lp.1.md   which produces lp1.js  Useful, right?

## Roadmap

lp1: Assemble the code out of order, each section has code that gets assembled into one code block.

lp2: Multiple files, substitutions using  _"My code block"  

lp3: Macros: test, debug, fiddle with parameters, examples. Project stuff?

lp4: In-Browser editor?
