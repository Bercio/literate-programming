# Replacing

How do we replace a section? 

Let's say we want to keep the historical perspective? We could copy and move an item, changing its name and replace it with something of the same heading. Would that be best?

What about  MV "p1" "p2"  where p1 is the path of the text that is used to replace the text of p2? We could also do CP and RM? This would be done after parsing but before compiling. 

This would seem to be wrong. How about an END directive that ends the parsing, effectively making everything below the end an extended comment.
