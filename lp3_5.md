# Literate Programming

This is the third cycle of literate programming. In this cycle, we want to implement directives and subheading directives. We will not implement macros at this time. 


## So far (modified)

Each file can specify the leading character(s) for a substitution, but an underscore will be default. To create a file, use FILE: name at the beginning of a line. Then all code in that block will define the contents of that file. 

Use FILE name

Use substitutions _"heading title" for replacements. 

There was a substitution regex idea, but there is use in having convention:
 
    /\_\"([^"]*)\"/
    


## Capital letters

We will use all caps to signify directives. The all caps letter only matches if there is something to match. 

A directive is an all caps as first word on the line. 

    FILE lp.js

We also use constants in code. The patten is caps and periods(in middle). So 

    p {color: MOJO.RED}
    

The reg would beginning

    /[A-Z][A-Z\.]*[A-Z]/

## Runnable Code

One should also be able to run JavaScript code directly in the interpreter. I think a decent convention would be underscore backtick code  backtick.        

    _`javascript code`

The eval output (last evaluated value) is what is placed in the code to replace the backtick call.

Before evaling the code, the substitutions are run on this. So if one wants to run a code block: 

    _`_"javascript code block"`
    
Not pretty, but it offers some flexibility. I imagine, most of the time, it should be a little bit of code fragment that is typed directly. One could have a directive that RUNs setup code allowing this bit to just read off from that. 

## Multi-level substitutions

There may be need to run substitutions after a first pass or more. For example, compiling a jade template into html and then running the substitutions that put in the text of the template. 

In this case, I think multiple underscores could do the trick. 

Example:

    #example
        _"nav jade"
        #text
             __"markdown text"
    

## Line analysis

So we have three basic things that we might see in code that the compiler needs to do something about:

1. Substitutions
2. Constants
3. Evaling

This is a method of a doc; it takes in a string for the code and the current block. It returns a string if replacements happened or false if none happened.

We run through the code string, matching block name/js code block/constant. We note the location, get the replacement text, and continue on. We also keep a look out for multi-level, preparing to reduce the level. 

Once all matches are found, we replace the text in the code block. 

We return 1 if there was a replacement, 0 if not.

For evaling, no substitutions are done. It is just straight, one line code. If evaling a block is needed use _"block to run|eval"


    function oneSub (codeBlocks, name, block) {
        
        var doc = this;

        _"Max sub limit"
        
        var code = codeBlocks[name];

        var reg = /(?:(\_+)(?:(?:\"([^"]+)\")|(?:\`([^`]+)\`))|([A-Z][A-Z.]*[A-Z]))/g;
        var rep = [];
        var toRun, match, replacementText;
        
        var blocks = doc.blocks;

        while ( (match = reg.exec(code) ) !== null ) {
            
            //multi-level 
        
            if (match[2]) {
                // section
                if (blocks.hasOwnProperty(match[2])) {
                    _"Matching block, multi-level"
                    
                    _"Substitute parsing"

                    rep.push([match[0], replacementText);
                }               
            } else if (match[3]) {
                // code
                _"Matching block, multi-level"
                
                rep.push([match[0], eval(match[3])]);

            } else {
                // constant
                if (doc.constants.hasOwnProperty(match[4])) {
                  rep.push([match[0], doc.constants[match[4]]]);
                }
            }

        }
        //do the replacements or return false
        if (rep.length > 0) {
            for (var i = 0; i < rep.length; i += 1) {
                code = code.replace(rep[i][0], rep[i][1].rawString());
            }

            codeBlocks[name] = code; 

            return 1; 
            
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
        
We need the function fullSub which runs through the code repeatedly until all substitutions are made. 

### Matching block, multi-level

There is a match, but the level is not yet ready  for full substitution

                    if (match[1] && match[1].length > 1) {
                        rep.push([match[0], match[0].slice(1)]);
                        continue;
                    }

### Max sub limit

We need to regard against infinite recursion of substituting. We do this by having a maximum loop limit. 

        if (doc.subtimes >= doc.maxsub) {
            return false;
        } else {
            doc.subtimes += 1;
        }

### Substitute parsing

This is where the whole structure is dealt with. 
    
    doc.fullSub(match[2], block)]

### The full substitution 

This compiles a block to its fullly substituted values.

JS

    function fullSub (block) {
        var doc = this;
        var name ; 
        var  code=[], blockCode, ret;

Check if already compiled. If so, return that.

        if (block.hasOwnProperty("compiled") ) {
            return block.compiled;
        } else {
            block.compiled = {};
        }

Cycle through the named code blocks, doing pre compiles

        for (name in block.code) {

            blockCode  = block.code[name];
            code[name] = blockCode.join("\n");
            code[name] = blockCode.pre(code[name], block, doc);
        
        }

Loop through all the names in each loop over substitution runs. This allows for subbing in at just the right moment. By using another code block with its own substitution, probably just about anything is possible. I think. Need to think up an example. 


            var counter = 0, go=1;
            while (go) {
                go = 0;
                counter += 1;
                for (name in code) {
                    go += doc.oneSub(code, name, block);
                    code[name] = blockCode.during(code[name], block, doc, counter);
                }
            }
        
Loop through the names one more time to get any post compile directives. 


        for (name in code) {
            code[name] = blockCode.post(code[name], block, doc); 
            block.compiled[name] = code; 
        }

        return block.compiled;
    }

There are three hooks for processing: pre, post, and during. The during object takes in an extra parameter that states which phase the process is in. 

#### Process types

Here we want to give an opportunity to process the types in relation to each other, probably using Macros for local subsitutions. 

As an example, we might have a bit of HTML that wraps around a marked up piece. Or we might have a test embedded that could be run on the code upon finished compiling. 



###### Example

awe is already joned and so it can be fed into marked immediately and consumed.

cool gets markedup after pre and then the eq is substituted in and in the second round it all is done. 

long takes three loops to compile. in the first loop, it is marked. in the second loop, long gets equation subbed in. in the third loop, it is installed. 

so the piping can process post compiled while the command switch can compile pre and during. 

HTML snip

    <p class="awesome">_"|awe|marked"/p>
    <p> class="lesscool">__"|cool"</p>
    <p> class="long">___"|long"</p>

MD awe 

    great work **dude**

MD cool marked(0)

    totally rad _"|eq"

MATH eq 

    \[\sin(x^2)*\int_5^8 \]

MD long marked(1)

    nearly done __"|eq"




So we may need delayed substitutions as well here.

HTML snip

    <p>Continuing the previous snip</p>

###### Example

HTML

    <p class="cool">Need some cool color</p>

CSS

    p.cool {color:blue}

HTML jack

    <p>not called</p>

CSS jack
    p {color:red}

HTML

    <p>Also in original block.</p>

This should be a good format. Let's say it is in a section called cool. Then we can get it by _"cool"; this will pull in the HTML in an html block while it will pull in CSS in a CSS block. Any other type will pull in nothing.  But we could add in _"cool|.css"  to pull in the css block. or _"cool|jack" to get jack. If multiple jacks, then  _"cool|jack.css". Space after pipe optional. So no pipes in name.  If we had a mark down section to convert to html, then we could do _"cool|.md|marked"  Any number of processors are possible. You can do a concatenate by _"cool|css|+jack.css|+.html"




## Recommendations

A lot of the literate programming for JavaScript might involve creating functions. One could just write it as 

    function name (parameters) {
      code
    }

in some code block. Let's say it is in section highfun

And then later on we could import them into some other control structure by using

    var fun = _"highfun";

or one could write

    var funobj = {
      fun : _"highfun",
    };

Note that we do want the heading to be inlined for this though one could write it on separate lines. 

## Directives parser

We will implement more directives. Directives will be recognized as, at the start of a line, as all caps and a matching word. This may be conflict, but seems unlikely. A space in front would defeat the regex. Periods are also allowed as in constants. At least two capital letters are required.

    function (line, doc) {     
      var reg = /^([A-Z][A-Z\.]*[A-Z])(?:$|\s+(.*)$)/;
      var match = reg.exec(line);
      if (match) {
        if (doc.directives.hasOwnProperty(match[1])) {
            doc.directives[match[1]](match[2], doc);
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
      } else {
        return false;
      }
    }

The function takes in a line and the doc structure. It either returns true if a successful directive match/execution occurs or it returns false. The directives object is an object of functions whose keys are the directive names and whose arguments are the rest of the line (if anything) and the doc object that contains the processors and current block structure. 


## Subsection Headings

Subsection headings refer to the higher level previous code block. One can write "#### Test"   (cap not matters) to write a test section for "## Great code".  This allows for the display of the markdown to have these sections hidden by default. 
Some possibilities as above, but also a doc type for writing user documentation. The literate programming is the developer's documentation, but how to use whatever can be written from within as well. 

By going two extra levels, we can recognize levels for testing and so forth without polluting the global namespace. Two levels could be those, such as examples, that should be for general review while three levels could be for edge case test cases, hidden by default. 

## Chunk headings

Parse out the section headings. These constitute "#+" followed by a name. Grab what follows. Parse code blocks indicated by 4 spaces in. One block per section reported, but can be broken up. Stitched together in sequence. 

To do this programmatically, we will split the whole text by newlines. At each line, analyze whether there is a "#" starting it--if so, get text after for name of section. At each line, check if there are four spaces. If so, add the line of code to the block. 

Each subheading is nested in the one above. So we need structures that hold the block and heading hierarchy.


## Parse lines

We create a function that takes in a literate program, splits it into lines, and parses them, returning a structure for compilation. 

The structure consists of blocks that are themselves objects with an array of code lines, an array of the full lines, an array of any direct descendants, any subdirectives, and then any other properties object. 

    function (lp, options) {
      var i, line, nn; 
      var doc = new Doc(options); 

      var lines = md.split("\n");
      doc.cur.level = 0; 
      var n = lines.length;
      for (i = 0; i < n; i += 1) {
        line = lines[i];
        nn = doc.processors.length;
        for (var ii = 0; ii < nn; ii += 1) {
            if (doc.processors[ii](line, doc) ) {
                doc.cur.full.push(line);
                break;
            }
        }
      }
      return doc;
    }

So we need to define four functions dealing with each type of object. They act on the doc object as necessary and will return true if successfully matched, short-circuiting the rest. 

### Document constructor

    Doc = function (options) {
        this.blocks = {};
        this.cur = new Block();
        this.files = [];
        this.log = [];
        this.subtimes = 0;

        this.directives = _"Directives";

        this.constants = {};


        this.processors = [].concat(this.defaultProcessors);
      
        console.log(this.processors);

        _"Merge in options"

        return this;
    };

    Doc.prototype.maxsub = 1e5;

    Doc.prototype.oneSub = _"Line analysis";
    Doc.prototype.fullSub = _"The full substitution";

    Doc.prototype.defaultProcessors = _"Default processors";



### Block constructor

    Block = function () {

        this.code = {};
        this.full = [];
        this.plain = [];
        this.subdire = [];

        return this;
    };

    Block.prototype.pre = function (code) { //, block, doc) {
        return code.trim();
    };

    Block.prototype.post = function (code) { //, block) { //, doc) {
        return code;
    };

    Block.prototype.during = function (code){  //, block, doc, counter) {
        return code;
    };



### Current structure

We have an array of code lines, the array of full lines, sub directive headings, and properties




### Default processors

The processors array allows us to change the behavior of the parser based on directives. They should return true if processing is done for the line. The argument is always the current line and the doc structure. 

    [ 
    _"Code parser", 
    _"Head parser", 
    _"Directives parser", 
    _"Plain parser" 
    ]


### Code parser

We look for 4 spaces of indentation. If so, it is code and we store it in the current code block. Alternative pathways are handled elsewhere by replacing cur.code with something else and restoring it as necessary.

    function (line, doc) {
      var reg = /^(?: {4}|\t)(.*)$/;
      var match = reg.exec(line);
      if (match) {
        doc.cur.code.push(match[1]);
        return true;

Added the following clause to add empty lines to the code. Stuff before and after the code block is probably trimmed, but in between extra lines could be added. This was to enable blank lines being there which is important for markdown and other markup languages. 

      } else if (line.match(/^\s*$/)  ) {
        doc.cur.code.push(line);
      } else {
        return false;
      }
    }




### Head parser

We recognize a heading by the start of a line having '#'. We count the number of sharps, let's call it level. The old level is oldLevel.

If level <= oldLevel +1, then we have a new subsection of code.

If level >= oldLevel +2, then this is a Heading Directive and we try to match it with a directive. It feeds directly into the oldLevel section and is not globally visible. 

For new global blocks, we use the heading string as the block name. 

    function (line, doc) {
      var level, oldLevel, cur, name;
      var head = /^(\#+)\s*(.+)$/;
      var match = head.exec(line);
      if (match) {
        name = match[2].trim();
        oldLevel = doc.level || 0;
        level = match[1].length;

        cur = new Block();


        // this shortcircuits if it is a directive heading
        _"Directive heading" 
                
        doc.blocks[name] = cur; 
        doc.cur = cur; 
        doc.cur.name = name;
        doc.level = level;
        doc.name = name;        
        // new processors for each section
        doc.processors = [].concat(doc.defaultProcessors);
        
        return true;
      } 
      return false;
    }

In the above, we are defining the default processors again fresh. This prevents any kind of manipulations from leaking from one section to another. It could be a performance penalty, but probably not a big deal. Garbage collection should remove old processors. 


#### Directive heading

Here we want to change the current block to take the current part, but it needs to be added to the parent's subdire

This will hide all blocks that have +2 level change or higher. Need to implment automatic running of subdire blocks. Might change this to seek a match for a directive heading. Or could use it to hide blocks; so look for substitution 

        if (level >= oldLevel +2) {
            level = oldLevel; 
            cur.parent = doc.cur.parent|| doc.cur;

            doc.cur = cur; 
            cur.parent.subdire.push(cur);
            return true;
        }

##### Directive heading running

A directive section needs to have the outer full substitution loop done separately because it is 


### Plain parser

This is a default. It means there is nothing special about the line. So we simply add it to the current full block.

    function (line, doc) {
      doc.cur.plain.push(line);
      return true;
    }

### Merge in options

In order to have more custom behavior, such as linking in behavior for visual editing, we want to be able to pass in options to the functions. 

We have just created the doc object. Now we take it and merge it in with the options object. 

    if (options) {
        var key;
        for (key in options) {
            this[key] = options[key];
        }
    }

## The lp module

Open the file to read and then read it, parse the lines,  piece them together, save file. 

    /*global require, module*/
    /*jslint evil:true*/

    var beautify = require('js-beautify').js_beautify;
    var jshint = require('jshint').JSHINT;
    var marked = require('marked');



    _"Utility Trim"
    _"Raw String"
    
    module.exports.compile = function (md, options) {

        var Block, Doc; 
        
        _"Document constructor"

        _"Block constructor"

        var lineparser = _"Parse lines";      

        Doc.prototype.lineparser = lineparser;
        Doc.prototype.makeFiles = _"Make files";

        var doc = lineparser(md, options);
        
        doc.makeFiles();
 
        return doc;
    };




FILE lib/literate-programming.js 
JS.HINT
JS.TIDY

### File instead

Could have directives on the line so FILE name  jshint  jstidy   or FILE name jsmin or this can also be a place to run the tests and not save if they fail or save to some other place. 

## Plugin functionality

Here we map out how to dynamically load directives, constants, and heading directives. We also establish automatically loaded files that can be suppressed by command line options. 


## Directives


Create the object that holds the directives. It will contain object names for any directives that need to be instituted. Each of the values should be a function that takes in the material on the line post-command and the doc which gives access to the current block and name. 


    { 
        "FILE" : _"File directive",
        "RAW" : _"Raw directive",

Below should be split off


        "JS.TIDY" : _"JS tidy",
        "JS.HINT" : _"JS hint",
        "MD.HTML" : _"Marked",
        "JS.PRE" : _"JS Pre"
    }


### Core directvies


#### File directive
     
The command is `FILE fname.ext` where fname.ext is the filename and extension to use. 

    function (options, doc) {
        options = options.trim();
        doc.files.push([options, doc.name]);
        doc.cur.file = options;
    }

#### Raw directive

Ignore the code bit and give back the raw full block. Mainly useful for markdown documents. 

To do this, we take out the code that would have been parsed in the pre mode. It loops once, doing nothing. Then in the post, we return the full portion. 

    function (options, doc) {
       doc.cur.pre = function () {
            return ""; 
       };

       doc.cur.post = function (code, block) {
           return block.plain.join("\n");
       };
    }


#### Load directive

This is to load other literate programs. It can compile them and save the files in the root directory (no arguments on LOAD) or it can start in a section and return the compiled version as the return value of that block. If multiple LOADs used in the same section, they get concatenated together. The Loading takes place immediately if no section, otherwise it starts in the compile phase. 


    function (options, doc) {
        options = options.split(","); 
        if (options.length > 1) {

            var pre = doc.cur.post;
            doc.cur.pre = function (code, block, doc) {
                code = pre(code, block, doc);
                _"Parse and load file"

               var section = options[1].trim();
               var code += exdoc.fullSub(section, exdoc); 

               return code;    
            };
        } else {
            _"Parse and load file";

            exdoc.

        }
    };


##### Parse and load file


        var fname = option[0].trim();
        if (fname) {
            if (doc.hasOwnProperty("external") ) {
                if (doc.external.hasOwnPropety(fname) ) {

                }
            } else {
                doc.external = {};
            }

do some parsing and loading

            doc.external[fname] = exdoc;
            //hackery!
            exdoc.fullSub = doc.fullSub;
            exdoc.oneSub = doc.oneSub;



#### Require directive

This is to load up various directives, constants, etc. It can be either a literate program with optional entry point(s) or a js file that compiles to an object whose keys can then be a list that adds. The object would have "whatever key" : [ {type: {object} } ]; the value can be a singleton instead of an array.

#### Version directive

Version control directive for the literate program. Generally at the base of the first intro block. This would be useful for setting up a npm-like setup. 

### Default directives

These are directives that are generally used, but whose loading can be turned off with a command line flag. They are hosted in a separate file. 

They often involve processing the compiled text and probably use various other modules. 




### Prototype of Directive

It runs immediately upon encountering. One probably wants to do some options parsing and then have something that works on doc.cur.pre/during/post 

    function (options, doc) {
        //post/pre/during
       var post = doc.cur.post;
       doc.cur.post = function (code, block, doc) {
           code = post(code, block, doc);
           code = //something awesome happens here
           return code;
       };

        // no return
    }


### JS tidy

Run the compiled code through JSBeautify 

    function (options, doc) {
       var post = doc.cur.post;
       doc.cur.post = function (code, block, doc) {
           code = post(code, block, doc);
           return beautify(code, options ||{ indent_size: 2, "jslint_happy": true } );
       };
    }
   
Needs js-beautify installed: `npm install js-beautify`

### JS hint

Run the compiled code through JSHint and output the results to console.

    function (options, doc) {
       var post = doc.cur.post;
       doc.cur.post = function (code, block, doc) {
           code = post(code, block, doc);
           jshint(code, options ||{ } );
           var data = jshint.data();
           block.jshint = {data:data, errors: [], implieds :[], unused :[]};
           var lines = code.split("\n");
           var log = [], err, i;
           for (i = 0; i < jshint.errors.length; i += 1) {
               err = jshint.errors[i];
               log.push("E "+ err.line+","+err.character+": "+err.reason +
                "  "+ lines[err.line-1]);
                block.jshint.errors.push({"line#": err.line, character: err.character, reason: err.reason, line: lines[err.line-1]} );
           }
           if (data.hasOwnProperty("implieds") ) {
             for (i = 0; i < data.implieds.length; i += 1) {
                 err = data.implieds[i];
                 log.push("Implied Gobal "+ err.line+": "+err.name +
                "  "+ lines[err.line[0]-1]);
                  block.jshint.implieds.push({"line#": err.line, name:err.name, line: lines[err.line[0]-1]} );

             }            
           }
          if (data.hasOwnProperty("unused") ) {
             for (i = 0; i < data.unused.length; i += 1) {
                 err = data.unused[i];
                 log.push("Unused "+ err.line+": "+err.name +
                "  "+ lines[err.line-1]);
                block.jshint.unused.push({"line#": err.line, name:err.name, line: lines[err.line-1]} );

             }            
           }


           if (log.length > 0 ) {
             log = ("!! JSHint:" + block.file+"\n"+log.join("\n"));
           } else {
             log = ("JSHint CLEAN: " + block.file);
           }

           doc.log.push(log);
           return code;
       };
    }

Needs jshint installed: `npm install jshint`   

### Marked

Run the text through the marked script to get html. Need to escape out underscored substitutions. 
    
    function (options, doc) {

        var lpsnip = [], mathsnip = [];

        var masklit = function (match) {
            lpsnip.push(match);
            return "LITPROSNIP"+(lpsnip.length -1);
        };

        var maskmath = function (match) {
            mathsnip.push(match);
            return "MATHSNIP"+(mathsnip.length-1);
        };

        var unmasklit = function (match, number) {
            return lpsnip[parseInt(number, 10)];
        };

        var unmaskmath = function (match, number) {
            return mathsnip[parseInt(number, 10)];
        };

        var modify = function (code, block, doc, options) {
            code = code.replace(/\_+(\"[^"]+\"|\`[^`]+\`)/g, masklit); 
            code = code.replace(/\$\$[^$]+\$\$|\$[^$\n]+\$|\\\(((?:[^\\]|\\(?!\)))+)\\\)|\\\[((?:[^\\]|\\(?!\]))+)\\\]/g, maskmath);
            code = marked(code);
            if (options.length > 0) {
                var elem = options[0];
                options = options.slice(1);
                _"Create attribute list"
                code = "<" + elem + " "+attributes+">"+code+"</"+elem+">";
            }
            code = code.replace(/LITPROSNIP(\d+)/g, unmasklit);
            code = code.replace(/MATHSNIP(\d+)/g, unmaskmath);
            return code;
        };

        _"Options on when"

    }

Needs marked installed: `npm install marked`   

### JS Pre

Encapsulate code into a Pre code element. Escape characters if necessary. Need to test. 

    function (options, doc) {

        var modify = function (code, block, doc, options) {
            _"Create attribute list"
            _"Escape code"
            return "<pre " + attributes + "><code>"+code+"</code></pre>";
        };

        _"Options on when"

    }  

#### Escape code

Replace <> with their equivalents. 

    code = code.replace(/</g, "&lt;");
    code = code.replace(/>/g, "&gt;");
    code = code.replace(/\&/g, "&amp;");

#### Unescape code

And to undo the escapes: 

    code = code.replace(/\&lt\;/g, "<");
    code = code.replace(/\&gt\;/g, ">");
    code = code.replace(/\&amp\;/g, "&");


### Options on when

When to process the text can be dependent. A common idiom will be to have a number as the first option which will say on which entry. It should be either -1 (pre), 0 (post), or a positive integer for during. If it does not fit that pattern, then a default of 0 for post is assumed. We assume there is a function in the environment named modify is assumed to work on the code and returns the new code text. 

    options = options.split(",") || [];

    if (options.length === 0) {
        options.push(0);
    } 

    var tempnum, tempmod; 

    if ( (tempnum = parseInt(options[0], 10) ) == options[0] ) {
        if (tempnum  === -1) {
            tempmod = doc.cur.pre;
            doc.cur.pre = function (code, block, doc) {
                code = tempmod(code, block, doc);
                code = modify(code, block, doc, options.slice(1));
                return code;
            };
        } else if (tempnum > 0) {
            tempmod = doc.cur.during;
            doc.cur.during = function (code, block, doc, counter) {
                code = tempmod(code, block, doc, counter);
                if (counter === tempnum) {
                    code = modify(code, block, doc, options.slice(1));
                }
                return code;
            };
        } else {
            tempmod = doc.cur.post;
            doc.cur.post = function (code, block, doc) {
                code = tempmod(code, block, doc);
                code = modify(code, block, doc, options.slice(1));
                return code;
            };    
        }
    }

### Create attribute list

We want to create an attribute list for html elements. The convention is that everything that does not have an equals sign is a class name. So we will string them together and throw them into the class, making sure each is a single word. The others we throw in as is. The id of the element is the block name though it can be overwritten with id="whatever". Options is an array that has the attributes.

    var i, option, attributes = "", klass = [], temp, 
        id = block.name.replace(/\s/g, "_"); // id may not contain spaces
    for (i = 0; i < options.length; i += 1) {
        option = options[i];
        if ( option.indexOf("=") !== -1 ) {
            // attribute found, check if id
            temp = option.split(/\s+/);
            if (temp[0] === "id" && temp[1] === "=") {
                id = temp[2];
            } else {
                attributes += option;
            }
        } else { // class
            klass.push(option.trim());
        }
    }
    attributes = "id='"+id+"' " + "class='"+klass.join(" ")+"' "+ attributes;



## Make files

We now want to assemble all the code. This function takes in a parsed lp doc and uses the files array to know which files to make and how to weave them together. 

So the plan is to go through each item in files. Call the full substitute method on it and then save it. 

    function () {
        var doc = this;
        var compiled = doc.compiled = {};
        var files = doc.files;
        var fname, blockname, text;
        for (var i = 0; i < files.length; i  += 1) {
            fname = files[i][0];
            blockname = files[i][1];
            text = doc.fullSub(blockname);
            compiled[fname] = [text, blockname];
        }
    }

The pre and post functions are hooks for running sections of code at appropriate times. They are implemented using directives.

### Utility Trim

This was lifted from JavaScript the Definitive Guide: 

    // Define the ES5 String.trim() method if one does not already exist.
    // This method returns a string with whitespace removed from the start and end.
    String.prototype.trim = String.prototype.trim || function() {
       if (!this) return this;                // Don't alter the empty string
       return this.replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g, ""); // Regular expression magic
    };

### Raw String

This code is for dealing with using replace with arbitrary strings. The dollar sign has special meaning in replacement strings. Since $$ is used for implementing math mode, its use in a replacement string leads to problems. But the return value from a function in a replacement string does not have this problem. Thus, I augmented the String type to have a method, rawString which produces a function that returns the string. 

    String.prototype.rawString = String.prototype.rawString || function () {
        var ret = this;
        return function () {return ret;};
    };



## Cli 

This is the command line file. It loads the literate programming document, sends it to the module to get a doc object, and then sends the file component to the save command. An optional second command-line 

    #!/usr/bin/env node

    /*global process, require, console*/
    var program = require('commander');
    var fs = require('fs');
    var lp = require('../lib/literate-programming');

    _"Command line options"


    var save = _"Save files";
 
_"Load file"

    var doc = lp.compile(md);
    save(doc.compiled, dir); 

    _"Cli log"

FILE bin/literate-programming.js
JS.HINT


### Load file

Get the filename from the command line arguments. It should be third item in [proccess.argv](http://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_argv).  

No need to worry about async here so we use the sync version of [readFile](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfilesync_filename_encoding).

    var filename = process.argv[2];
    if (!filename) {
        console.log("Usage: litpro file-to-compile optional:directory-to-place-result");
        process.exit();
    }
    var dir = process.argv[3];
    var md = fs.readFileSync(filename, 'utf8');


### Save files
    
Given array of name and text, save the file. dir will change the directory where to place it. This should be the root directory of all the files. Use the filenames to do different directories. 

    function (files, dir) {
        if (dir) {
            process.chdir(dir);
        }
        for (var name in files) {
            // name, text
          console.log(name + " saved");
          fs.writeFileSync(name, files[name][0], 'utf8');
        }

    }


### Cli log

This is where we report the logs. 

    console.log(doc.log.join("\n\n"));

### Command line options

Here we define what the various configuration options are. 


    program
        .version('0.1')
        .usage('[options] <file>')
        .option('-d --dir <root>', 'Root directory')
    ;

    program.parse(process.argv);

    if ((! program.args[0]) ) {
        console.log("Need a file");
        process.exit();
    }

    var dir = program.dir; 
    var md = fs.readFileSync(program.args[0], 'utf8');

#### Command arguments doc

    Currently there is only one flag: -d or --dir  with a directory that specifies the root directory where the compiled files go.

I always have to look up the RegEx stuff. Here I created regexs and used their [exec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/exec) method to get the chunks of interest.

## README

MD

    literate-programming
    ====================
    
    Write a program using markdown to write out your thoughts and the bits of code that go with those thoughts. This program weaves the bits together into usable fiels. 

    ## Installation

    This is not yet operational, but soon: 

        npm install -g literate-programming

    ## Using

    The command installed is literate-programming and it has some command flags and one primary argument which is the markdown document containing the program, or at least the structure of the project. 

        literate-programming sample.md 

    will create the files specified in sample.md

    ### Command flags
    _"Command arguments doc"


    ## Document syntax

    A literate program is a markdown document with some special conventions. 

    The basic idea is that each header line (regardless of level) demarcates a full block. Any code blocks within a full block are concatenated together and are the code portion of the block. 

    Each code block can contain whatever kind of code, but there are three special syntaxes (space between underscore and quote should not be present; it is there to avoid processing): 

    1. _ "Block name" This tells the compiler to compile the block with "Block name" and then replace the _ "Block name" with that code.
    2. _ `javascript code`  One can execute arbitrary javascript code within the backticks, but the parser limits what can be in there to one line. This can be circumvented by having a block name substitution inside the backticks. 
    3. CONSTANTS/MACROS all caps are for constants or macro functions that insert their output in place of the caps. 

    For both 1 and 3, if there is no match, then the text is unchanged. One can have more than one underscore for 1 and 2; this delays the substitution until another loop. It allows for the mixing of various markup languages and different processing points in the life cycle of compilation.

    Outside of a code block, if a line starts with all caps, this is potentially a directive. For example, the `FILE` directive takes the name of a file and it will compile the current block and save it to a file. 

    If a heading level jumps down by two or more levels (say level 2 going to level 4), then this is also a potential directive. It allows for the use of a TEST section, for example, that can automatically run some tests on a compiled block.

    ## Nifty parts of writing literate programming

    You can write code in the currently live document that has no effect, put in ideas in the future, etc. Only those on a compile path will be seen. 

    You can have your code in any order you wish. 

    You can "paste" multiple blocks of code using the same block name. 

    You can put distracting data checks/sanitation/transformations into another block and focus on the algorithm without the use of functions (which can be distracting). 

    You can use JavaScript to script out the compilation of documents, a hybrid of static and dynamic.

RAW

An in-browser version is planned. The intent is to have it be an IDE for the literate program. 

More docs.

Allow for mutlitple code blocks in one block; each mini block should either add something to the whole or it could contribute to another kind; so one bit could be html, one bit could be css and one could be js and another markdown. ???

Allow for a plugin setup for directives and constants. 

Add in core directives: require (plugin), load (other literate programs), version....

Fix up javacsript code parsing in backticks to do subs.

## The Docs

Here we write the basic docs for the user.

    lp3 is the third iteration of the literate programming attempt by jostylr. It handles multiple files, substitutions, macros, and subheading directives. 

    To run this, the basic command is

        node lp3.js file.md
    
    where file.md is the literate program to be parsed.

    The literate program has multiple sections that get weaved together. 

    _"Directives Doc"

    _"Substitution Doc"

    _"Subheading directives Doc"

    _"Further information on literate programming"


 //FILE: lp3Doc.md

### Further information on literate programming






## Directive Implementation

* FILE already present; puts the code block and its substitutions in a file. regex?
* ADD take this code block and add it to another codeblock. Specify pre, post, and a possible priority level. 
* DEBUG Some debugging output code. 
* RETURN returns control to other code block
* LOAD give file name, location, section to import, version number. Create a literate program manager kind of thing like npm. Have tests that run to make sure compatible. Could do latest if it passes and works back until working version or something. 
* MODULE grab a module from a repository:  install command, link to repo/other comments
* COMMAND write a command line snippet that will be run. SECURITY problem. 
* VERSION gives a version label to the section. Semantics is the version number followed by any comments about it. 
* AFTER/BEFORE/REPLACE takes in section name, regex string to match and will place the code block after the match/before the match/instead of the match respectively. It will do 


### JavaScript Directives

* VARS A list of the variables for the snippet of interest. This is mainly to deal with loop variables. 
* HEREVARS places the variables of a section there. It can be a comma separated list of headings; the vars will be placed in that order.
* SET/TEST/RESULT is a test code for snippets. SET will set variable values for multiple tests, TEST will then run the snippet and RESULT checks it. 

In all of these a parenthetical right after the term will link it to that section. Otherwise, it relates to the current code block section. 

TEST for example could have some code above it (with substitutions) and then TEST will create one (many) tests of that code block. To get back to the rest of the code block, use RETURN. 

### Directives object

    { 
      ADD : _"Add",
      DEBUG : _"Debug",
      FIDDLE : _"Fiddle",
      RETURN : _"Return",
      LOAD : _"Load",
      MODULE : _"Module",
      REQUIRE : _"Require",
      VERSION : _"Version
    }
    

### Load 

The load directive allows one to load another literate program. This means one has to specify a location (file system or url), a version number, and a section heading to start the grabbing/compiling. One should detect looping, with failure as the probable result. 

MODULE npm, semver, [semver](https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver)

    
##### DOC

The LOAD directive is of the form LOAD: (section heading), (path or URL), (number and dots for version as in [npm's versioning](https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html#version) )

What it does is find the literate program specified, check versioning/tests, compile the code, and leave it as an otherwise normal block in the named section. 

In the file, there can be a directive about versions. There can be multiple versions.

##### EXAMPLE

Let's assume there is an example.md literate program with a section "Test Me". Then in a descriptive fashion, we would wax on about what we are using and why and whatever. Then the directive:

    LOAD: "Test Me", https://github.com/jostylr/literateprogramming/lp1.md, 4.2 
 
"Test Me" should have a directive VERSION:4.2

Then we could write some test code to confirm the behavior. 

### Add

Take this code block and add it to another codeblock. Specify pre, post, and a possible priority level. 

    function (params, current) {
      params = params.split(',');
      var block = params[0];
      var type = params[1];
      if ( (type !== "pre") && (type !== "post") ) {
        error(current, type);
      }
      var number = params[2] || 1;
      number = parseFloat(number);
      if (blocks.hasOwnProperty(block) ) {
        blocks[block][type].push([number, current]);
      } else {
        blocks[block] = [];
      }
    }


##### DOC

The format is  `ADD: "block name", "pre|post", "?#"`  where we are adding the current block to the given block name. We put it before/after depending on pre/post. If there is a number, then the larger it is, the further away from the given code block it is relative to other adders. A default of 1 is assumed. 


### Debug

This is a place that can input debugging code.

    function (params, current) {
      if (debug) {

      }
    }


* DEBUG Some debugging output code. 
* FIDDLE Something that allows one to specify different parameters and generate multiple compiles/runs or something. 
* RETURN returns control to other code block
* LOAD give file name, location, section to import, version number. Create a literate program manager kind of thing like npm. Have tests that run to make sure compatible. Could do latest if it passes and works back until working version or something. 
* MODULE different than LOAD. It loads a npm module or whatever is specfied. 
* REQUIRE is a marker for where to place modules for that section of code. All MODULEs are placed at that point, in the order they are seen.
* VERSION gives a version label to the section. Semantics is the version number followed by any comments about it.
